Introduction: This program checks whether a given number is a palindrome. A palindrome number reads the same forward and backward.

Explanation of Variables:

rev starts at 0 and will store the reversed number.
x holds the original value of num to compare later.
While Loop Logic:

The condition while num > 0 ensures the loop continues until all digits of num are processed.
Inside the loop:
rev = (rev * 10) + num % 10: This multiplies rev by 10 to shift digits and adds the remainder of num divided by 10 (extracting the last digit).
num = num // 10: This reduces num by removing its last digit (integer division).
Comparison:

After the loop, rev contains the reversed number.
The program compares rev to x (the original number).
If they are equal, the number is a palindrome; otherwise, itâ€™s not.
